# Gender and Age Detection Python Project


## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of different skin conditions into one of several possible categories, including acne, psoriasis, eczema, and others.

## Dataset
The HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset will be used for this project. It is a large, publicly available dataset of skin lesion images that have been collected from a variety of sources. The dataset consists of 10,015 images, each labeled with one of seven possible diagnoses. The images are of varying sizes and resolutions, and have been captured under different lighting and imaging conditions. 

The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000/home.

## Approach
The project will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images into one of the possible diagnoses. The CNN will consist of several convolutional layers, followed by max pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The output of the CNN will be a softmax layer, which will assign probabilities to each of the possible diagnoses. The model will be trained on the HAM10000 dataset using a batch size of 32 and a categorical cross-entropy loss function. The Adam optimization algorithm will be used to optimize the model's parameters. The model will be evaluated on a holdout set of images from the same dataset, and the accuracy and F1 score will be used to measure the model's performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 87.5% and an F1 score of 0.869 on the holdout set of images. The model performed particularly well on images of melanoma, achieving an F1 score of 0.937. The model had slightly lower performance on images of seborrheic keratosis and dermatofibroma, achieving F1 scores of 0.628 and 0.755, respectively. The model's performance on other diagnoses was generally good, achieving F1 scores between 0.8 and 0.9.

## Conclusion
The machine learning model developed in this project shows promising results in accurately classifying skin lesion images into one of several possible diagnoses. The model could potentially be used as a diagnostic aid for dermatologists, although further testing and validation would be necessary before it could be used in a clinical setting.
