## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection system for credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a significant problem that costs billions of dollars to financial institutions each year. This project aims to help financial institutions prevent fraud by identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time and preventing them from going through.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 are fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of the total transactions.

The dataset contains the following features:

1. Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset

2. V1-V28: Principal components obtained through PCA transformation to anonymize the features in the dataset

3. Amount: Transaction amount

4. Class: 1 if the transaction is fraudulent, 0 otherwise


## Approach:
We will be using machine learning algorithms to build a classification model that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. We will preprocess the data by scaling the features, dealing with missing values and outliers, and performing feature selection. Then, we will train several machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. We will also explore techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to address the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

## Results:
The final model will be evaluated on a test set and compared to baseline models. The performance of the model will be measured using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. The results will be presented to stakeholders, and the model will be deployed to production if it meets the performance requirements.

## Conclusion:
By developing a fraud detection system, financial institutions can save millions of dollars in losses due to fraudulent transactions. The model can help detect fraudulent transactions in real-time and prevent them from going through, thus reducing the impact of fraud on customers and the financial institution. The use of machine learning algorithms and data-driven techniques can help improve the accuracy of the model and reduce false positives and false negatives.
