This repository contains the code for the projects completed during the Data Science Internship at InfoPillar Solutions. The projects are:

1. Breast Cancer Classification Master

2. Customer Segmentation

3. Gender and Age Detection Python Project

4. Movie Recommendation System

5. Breast Cancer Classification Master

This project aims to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The model achieved an accuracy of 97.18%.


## Customer Segmentation
This project is about segmenting customers based on their purchasing patterns using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset used is the Wholesale customers dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.



## Gender and Age Detection Python Project
This project detects gender and age of a person from an image using the OpenCV library in Python.



## Movie Recommendation System
This project recommends movies to users based on their ratings of other movies. The dataset used is the MovieLens dataset, and the model was created using Collaborative Filtering.

All projects include the code and necessary datasets used for training and testing. Please refer to the individual project folders for more details.
